# MS2-Project - The Dogey Game

Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development.


Wanted to make a memory game of some sort of a memory game that had some sort of correlation to something I am part of or enjoy
doing so i went with Crypto Currencys. The currencys on scrren are the ones I have in my portfolio. 

This game is a very basic game as I am still getting used to using Java I found this my hardest task so far as it needs to be 
something that I like.
