# MS2-Project - The Dogey Game

Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development.


Wanted to make a memory game of some sort of a memory game that had some sort of correlation to something I am part of or enjoy
doing so i went with Crypto Currencys. The currencys on scrren are the ones I have in my portfolio. 

This game is a very basic game as I am still getting used to using Java I found this my hardest task so far as it needs to be 
something that I like.

# Languages used for this Project.

CSS 
HTML
Javascript

# Features

Main and only feature really is the main grid which is all javascript.

# Features I want to do in the future

In the future i want to add some sounds for when the game ends it makes a little few second sound to say "well done" or "congratulations".

I want to add in where the cards flip back over smoothly if I get the cards wrong. 

# Testing 

Throughout all of the game I kept on testing the game to make sure on when I click on the selected cards they all respond 
and reset nicely.

I personally tested the game alot and tested diffrent colour schemes to try make sure visually it didnt look to bad.
